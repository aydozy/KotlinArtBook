# Art Book - Mini App
With this application, we were able to learn and practice the following:
- Permissions
- SQLite
- Bitmap

## Permission

Android Studio made it mandatory to ask permission from users after API 23. Thanks to these permissions, we can access the user's gallery or any information on his/her phone with permission.

Although these permissions may seem confusing in the code, we will realize we are always doing the same thing.

## Bitmap

A bitmap is a representation of an image that consists of pixels with a specified width, height, and color format. A Bitmap from a View is a Bitmap that is created from a View in your Android application.
